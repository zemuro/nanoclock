An Arduino MIDI/trigger/gate master clock

Basically, a hardware clone of https://github.com/MarcBoule/ImpromptuModular/#clocked

Used some code and ideas from https://github.com/DieterVDW/arduino-midi-clock,
C++ reference https://en.cppreference.com/w/
Great help and encouragement from the Stack Overflow community (never had to post though, but found a plethora of good solutions)
